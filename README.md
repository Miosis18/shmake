## About The Project

I was given the task of making lots of small linux projects for a class test, it got tedious to keep making new shells and then manually adding in the permissions and comments. I decided instead of doing that I would make one simple script once that would do it for me everytime I needed it in the future.<br>

Out of my laziness came shmake, shamke basically just means shell maker.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the file and add it to a folder in your distro, you can either move this file to your bin folder or make a new folder and add that to your path.

### Guide

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Make your own folder
  ```sh
  mkdir $HOME/bin
  mv shmake $HOME/bin
  nano ~/.bashrc
  # ADD THE LINE BELOW INTO YOUR BASHRC FILE
  export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```
  
* Add to root bin folder
  ```sh
  mv shmake /bin
  ```
